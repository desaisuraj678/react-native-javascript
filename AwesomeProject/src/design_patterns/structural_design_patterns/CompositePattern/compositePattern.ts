/*
 - The Composite design pattern is a structural pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
 -  It allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly (imp)
 - consists of three parts :
       1. Component interface  (The Component interface describes operations that are common to both simple and complex elements of the tree)
       2. Leaf class
       3. Composite class

 - Use the pattern when you want the client code to treat both simple and complex elements uniformly.
