Application layer can be divided into 2 parts
     - Client server protocol (http,smtp,web sockets,ftp)
     - peer to peer protocol  (webrtc)


- http     : 1 connection is establised     tcp 
- ftp (file transfer protocol)  : 2 connections are established   tcp
- SMTP  : is used for sending the mail  tcp
- web sockets are bidirectional in nature and its communication is between client and server (not peer to peer)
        (messaging app)





- WebRTC
In peer to peer if p1 , p2 are peers and s1 is server then anyone can talk with anybody


Transport layer can be divided into 2 protocols
  - TCP/IP  Transmission Control Protocol
  - UDP/IP  User Datagram Protocol
