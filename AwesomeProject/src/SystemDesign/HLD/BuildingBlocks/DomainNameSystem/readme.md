# Domain name system (DNS)

-  DNS serves as the Internet’s phone book.
-  The domain name system (DNS) is the Internet’s naming service that maps human-friendly domain names to machine-readable IP addresses
-  When a user enters a domain name in the browser, the browser has to translate the domain name to IP address by asking the DNS infrastructure.
